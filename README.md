The Digital Library of Late-Antique Latin Texts (*DigilibLT*) currently contains 373 secular prose texts written in Latin in late antiquity (from the second to the seventh century AD). The digital texts are taken from the home of the DigilibLT project at https://digiliblt.uniupo.it/index.php, where they can be downloaded in various formats. The original texts were in TEi conformant XML files, these were lemmatised and PoS tagged with the UDPipe tool, using an in-house built trained model based on different UD Latin treebanks. The output of UDPipe still needs checking and disambiguating. This upload consists in a *Bronze* level of linking and still needs lots of manual checking.
